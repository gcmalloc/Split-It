This Vim pluging is dead simple. And by dead simple I mean if you can't understand it I swear I will find you and kill you.

Anyways...

Split-It creates multiple split viewports by taking in a variable amount of arguments. Each argument passed represents a column and it's value is the number of rows in that column. It's probably easier to understand with an example so check these examples out:

--

:SplitIt 2

This would create a single column with a top and bottom viewport.

--

:SplitIt 2 2

This would create 4 view ports. 2 columns with 2 rows.

---

:Split 1 3

This would create a single tall view on the left and 3 stacked views to the right of that.

NOTE: Right now you can not have rows that span more than a single column. I am currently trying to decide the best way to easally express more advanced viewport layouts in a simple format.
